# Tweemail
This program collects the latest tweets from a user or a list of users and sends them via email. 

<i>I created this program when the situation in Ukraine escalated, and I couldn't keep updated with all the news. So I researched and screened all the users, who can be responsible for their tweets on the ground such as war reporters, humanitarian workers, diplomats, official channels etc. This program collected all the relevant information and was easy to oversee in one table.</i>
